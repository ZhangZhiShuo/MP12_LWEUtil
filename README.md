# MP12_LWEUtil
This is our implementation code for MP12 TrapdoorGen and SamplePre algorithms by using the sagemath and cupy library.
This code repository implements the core lattice-based algorithms from the MP12 paper, serving as fundamental building blocks for constructing cryptographic schemes based on hard problems like LWE (Learning With Errors) and SVP (Shortest Vector Problem) and their variants. The code was developed, debugged, and open-sourced by Dr. Zhang Zhishuo and Professor Liao Yongjian from the Cyberspace Security Laboratory, School of Information and Software Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.
